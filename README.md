Created by Jeht Games Studio

Privacy point:
This app does not track activity of the user. The only information I receive the the country of installing an app. If you have any questions, please email me at jehtgamesstudio@gmail.com.

Type of personal and sentitive user data: I don't really collect any private infromation. Everytime the app the closed, nothing is saved. you progress is erased as the game does not have anything like high scores. When the app is install, I am told what country it is installed in. 
The information is anonymous, so it can't be tracked back to an individual user. 

If I gotta say, I can do anything I want with that information listed above. Again, it's anonymous, so it really can't be used to track the users.

Data handling prcedure is just on google or webintoapp.com.

Data rention:
I have no idea how long I plan to keep the data. Again, it can be used to track individual users. It just remembers what country your application was installed.
